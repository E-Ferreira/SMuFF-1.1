# Sample Configuration Files

Copy one of these files as "SMUFF.CFG" onto the SMuFFs SD-Card before you start it up.

The \*_Duet.CFG defines all settings needed if you're running the SMuFF with a Duet3D controller board.
The \*_PMMU.CFG defines all settings needed if you're running the SMuFF in Prusa MMU emulation mode.

Configuration files with *Servo* in the name were needed if you've built the SMuFF servo version.
